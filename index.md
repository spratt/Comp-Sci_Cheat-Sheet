### [Array](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-java/2_Array_Based_Lists.html)

A fixed number of sequential memory locations, into which data is
inserted sequentially beginning with the lowest or highest memory
address.  A counter keeps track of how many of the memory locations
contain data.  

This structure provides constant-time access to any element and
constant-time insertion or removal at the end, using constant extra
space.

### [Linked List](http://opendatastructures.org/ods-java/3_Linked_Lists.html)

A pointer to a series of nodes, each of which contain a datum and a
pointer to the next node in the list.

This structure provides constant removal from the start, and a pointer
to the tail is a simple optimization which allows constant-time
insertion at the end.
