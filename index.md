## Abstract Data Types

An ADT is a set of operations on a data structure that provide an
interface for manipulating the data for use in algorithms.

### List

A list provides access to an ordered set of elements.

### Stack, Queue, Deque

Stacks, queues, and deques are lists in which the first and last
elements (called the "ends") are especially easy to add or remove.  A
stack is a structure which supports insertion and removal from one end
in constant time.  A queue is a structure which supports insertion
from one end, and removal from the other end in constant time.
